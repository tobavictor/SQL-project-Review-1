Retail Sales SQL Analysis

Level: Beginner
Database: TOBA

This project is a practical replication and adaptation of @najirh’s Retail Sales Analysis, restructured for my own SQL learning and analysis practice. It demonstrates essential SQL concepts used by data analysts to clean, explore, and derive insights from retail sales data.

🎯 Project Objectives

Database Setup: Create and populate a retail sales database (TOBA) using transactional sales data.

Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing or inconsistent records to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use SQL queries to understand patterns across categories, dates, and customer segments.

Business Insights: Write analytical SQL queries to answer real-world business questions such as best-selling months, customer purchasing behavior, and sales by category.

Project Structure
1️⃣ Database Setup

Created a new SQL database named TOBA.

Built and loaded a table (Project1) containing retail sales data with columns including:

transaction_id,
sale_date, 
sale_time
customer_id,
gender,
age,
category,
quantity,
price_per_unit,
cogs,
total_sale


SQL Tasks & Analysis

Filtered transactions by date and category.

Calculated KPIs such as total and average monthly sales.

Used window functions (RANK, PARTITION BY) to identify top-performing categories and months.

Grouped and aggregated data to find insights on gender-based purchases and time-based sales trends.

Segmented transactions into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening shifts for behavioral analysis.


Key Learnings

Practical application of aggregate and window functions.

Importance of data cleaning in SQL before analysis.

Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for readable, modular queries.

Ranking and ordering logic for analytical insights.

🧠 Credits

This project was inspired by and adapted from the original Retail Sales Analysis by @najirh.
All analysis and SQL enhancements were recreated and extended for personal learning and exploration.
